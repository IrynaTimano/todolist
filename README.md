# todolist

This app will allow you to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed.
Save the code below in an HTML file (e.g., todo_list.html) and open it in your web browser to use the "To-Do List" app.

In this example, you can enter a task in the input field and click the "Add Task" button to add it to the to-do list. Each task in the list has "Remove" and "Complete" buttons that allow you to remove the task from the list or mark it as completed.
The example also includes three example tasks added on page load to give you an idea of how the app works.
Feel free to customize and expand the "To-Do List" app further by adding features like task persistence (saving tasks in local storage), editing tasks, or organizing tasks into different categories. The possibilities are endless!
